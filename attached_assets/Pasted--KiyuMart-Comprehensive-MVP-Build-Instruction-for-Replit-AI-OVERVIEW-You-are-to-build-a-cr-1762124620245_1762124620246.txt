🚀 KiyuMart — Comprehensive MVP Build Instruction (for Replit AI)
🧩 OVERVIEW

You are to build a cross-platform e-commerce software called KiyuMart, using React (Vite) for frontend and Node.js + Express for backend.
Data should be stored in MongoDB, and all files (images/videos) in Cloudinary.
The project must be 100% exportable and run independently of Replit.

KiyuMart is both a single-store fashion marketplace and a multi-vendor marketplace, switchable by the Super Admin.
In single-store mode, only one store is visible (like a full fashion app).
In multi-vendor mode, sellers can register and sell, and the Super Admin can approve or manage them.

The app must have dynamic control, delivery management, Paystack integration, real-time chat, in-app calling, multi-language, multi-currency, fingerprint & PIN security, and fully dynamic configuration from the Super Admin dashboard.

🏗️ TECH STACK

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Zustand or Redux for state management

Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
