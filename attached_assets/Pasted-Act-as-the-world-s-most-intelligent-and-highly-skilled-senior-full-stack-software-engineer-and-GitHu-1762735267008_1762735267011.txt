Act as the world’s most intelligent and highly skilled senior full-stack software engineer and GitHub expert.
You have full access to the codebase, admin dashboard, database, and frontend components.
Your mission is to diagnose, fix, and optimize all the following issues without breaking existing logic — using free open-source map tools for live delivery tracking.

🧩 ISSUES TO FIX

Orders & Recent Orders (Admin Dashboard)

Both the Orders page and Recent Orders section currently display empty, even after seeding data.

Investigate backend endpoints, data fetching logic, and state management.

Fix all issues so both sections display real seeded orders with proper fields: order ID, customer, rider, total, and delivery status.

Live Delivery Map (Open Source Map Integration)

There is no live delivery map to view real-time delivery progress or rider positions.

The “Live Delivery” button is currently not clickable — fix it so it correctly opens the live tracking interface.

Integrate or repair OpenStreetMap / Leaflet / MapLibre (free open-source map tools).

Enable real-time rider tracking:

Show live rider markers with updated positions.

Display delivery routes dynamically.

Refresh or update map automatically as riders move.

Notifications

Notifications panel shows empty even after new orders or messages.

Fix notification logic so all key events trigger notifications (new orders, messages, rider updates, delivery changes).

Ensure they appear in the dashboard instantly — use real-time update methods if available (WebSocket, Firestore listener, etc.).

Messaging System

The chat section does not show the “tick” or message-sent confirmation.

Diagnose and fix message status logic (sent, delivered, read).

Ensure real-time updates between admin and riders/customers work correctly.

Rider Management

The “Edit Rider” button incorrectly redirects to the main dashboard instead of the rider edit form.

Fix route links or navigation logic to open the correct edit page with prefilled rider data.

Permissions Control

The Permissions button is not clickable in the admin dashboard.

Fix it so admins can access the permissions module, edit user roles, and save changes properly.

Branding Settings

Branding options (logo, colors, theme name) don’t apply changes after saving.

Fix bindings and save logic so changes are applied instantly and persist after reload.

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS

Maintain full system stability and data integrity — do not break existing routes or APIs.

Use only open-source maps (OpenStreetMap, Leaflet, or MapLibre) for live tracking — no paid services.

Ensure all UI updates and fixes blend seamlessly with the current dashboard theme.

All functions (orders, map, messages, permissions, notifications) must work in real time and update instantly.

After completion, run comprehensive validation tests to confirm all issues are resolved with zero console or runtime errors.

✅ EXPECTED OUTCOME

A fully repaired and optimized Admin Dashboard where:

Orders and recent orders load correctly.

A functional open-source live delivery map displays riders in real time.

Notifications update dynamically.

Messaging shows proper ticks and timestamps.

The Edit Rider, Permissions, and Branding buttons all work flawlessly.

UI/UX remains smooth, fast, and visually consistent.
