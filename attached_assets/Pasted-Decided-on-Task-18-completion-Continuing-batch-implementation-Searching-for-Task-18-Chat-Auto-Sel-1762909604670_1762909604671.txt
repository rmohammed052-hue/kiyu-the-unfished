⚠️ Task 19 - Issue Discovered:
The "Live Tracking Rating" task requires replacing a hardcoded rider rating with actual review data. However, the database has no rider review system - only product reviews exist.

Options:

Create rider review system (database schema + API + UI) - significant scope increase
Calculate estimated rating from rider delivery metrics (completion rate, delivery count)
Keep as enhancement for separate feature implementation
Recommendation: Should I implement a calculated rating based on delivery performance metrics (e.g., riders with 50+ deliveries get 4.5+ stars), or would you prefer a full rider review system as a separate feature?

Current Status:

8 tasks fully complete ✅
1 task blocked (needs clarification) ⚠️

What would you like me to do for the rider rating? Then I'll continue with the next batch of tasks
