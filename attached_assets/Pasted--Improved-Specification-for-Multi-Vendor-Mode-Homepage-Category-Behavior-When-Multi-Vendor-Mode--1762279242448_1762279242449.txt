✅ Improved Specification for Multi-Vendor Mode Homepage & Category Behavior

When Multi-Vendor Mode is ON, the entire app should switch from a single-store fashion layout to a unified marketplace layout.
The goals:

✅ Central marketplace homepage
✅ All store categories displayed equally
✅ Category components shrink dynamically when more stores/categories are added
✅ Avoid overlap, excessive spacing, or broken alignment
✅ Super Admin controls all UI content & layout styles in multi-vendor mode

✅ 1. CATEGORY BEHAVIOR IN MULTI-VENDOR MODE
✅ Single Store → Becomes a Single Category Tile

If the system was originally a single fashion store (as shown in your screenshot), then:

That entire fashion store becomes ONE small category.

The category name = Fashion or the store’s category name you assign.

The big hero cards (Elegant Abayas, Evening Wear, Hijabs, etc.) must not appear in multi-vendor mode.

✅ All Vendor Stores = One Category Each

Every approved vendor/store becomes a category tile:

Each store = one category card

Image = vendor's store logo or banner thumbnail

Title = vendor store name

Subtitle = number of products in that store

✅ Dynamic Auto-Resizing of Category Cards

The category grid must:

Automatically shrink cards when new stores are added

Maintain equal spacing

Avoid overflow or weird spacing gaps

Always appear clean, balanced, and symmetrical

Think: responsive Pinterest-style grid but uniform card height.

Rule:

If categories ≤ 3 → show large cards (1 row)
If categories 4–6 → medium cards (2 rows)
If categories > 6 → auto-responsive grid with small cards

✅ 2. HOMEPAGE IN MULTI-VENDOR MODE

The homepage becomes a centralized marketplace:

✅ Featured Products (Global)

Show all vendors’ featured products, not just the single-store fashion products.

✅ New Arrivals (Global)

Fetch all product categories from all stores.

✅ Trending / Best Sellers (Global)

Top products across all stores, not filtered by fashion.

✅ Category Strip (Global)

A horizontally scrollable or grid-based category list of all stores.

✅ Admin Controls All Homepage Elements

The Super Admin can change:

Homepage banner

Homepage tagline / hero text

Featured section layout (grid/carousel)

Category display style:

Grid (default)

Horizontal scrolling

Dropdown categories

Minimal icons only

Number of categories visible before collapse

Product blocks (size, padding, display type)

Everything in multi-vendor mode is platform-level and not vendor-controllable.

✅ 3. STORE LANDING PAGE (Vendor Page) – Multi-Vendor Mode

Each vendor receives a store landing page, BUT:

✅ Super Admin controls page layout

Even though sellers manage products, the store design itself must be:

Admin-controlled

Locked from vendor modification

Unified across all stores

Including:

Banner style or default banner

Category layout

Section appearance

Typography

Buttons

Product card layout

What sections appear or don’t appear

Vendor controls only:

Products

Prices

Discounts

Stock

Store metadata (logo, name, description)

Everything else is platform-wide controlled by Super Admin.

✅ 4. HOMEPAGE BANNER IN MULTI-VENDOR MODE

The multi-vendor banner MUST:

✅ Not be Islamic-themed
✅ Be neutral and centered
✅ Match all store types
✅ Show a global marketplace feel
✅ Be fully changeable by the Super Admin

Admin can choose:

Banner image

Banner text

CTA buttons

Banner height/size

Whether banner appears above or below category grid

✅ 5. LAYOUT & RESPONSIVENESS REQUIREMENTS
✅ Prevent Overlap

Category tiles must:

Shrink proportionally

Auto-wrap

Maintain fixed aspect ratio

Use CSS grid or FlutterFlow responsive wrap

Avoid overflow on small devices

✅ Spacing Rules

Cards must always have equal horizontal spacing

Vertical spacing must be consistent regardless of tile count

No empty gaps or stretched cards

✅ Visual Cleanliness

Rounded corners

Uniform shadows

Even padding

Same height for all category tiles

Consistent font sizes across all stores

✅ 6. WHAT TO REMOVE IN MULTI-VENDOR MODE

Remove the entire fashion-based homepage, including:

❌ Elegant Abayas section
❌ Evening Wear section
❌ Hijabs & Accessories
❌ Any Islamic-fashion specific hero components
❌ Fashion-only homepage categories
❌ Single-store banners

Only the unified marketplace should remain.
