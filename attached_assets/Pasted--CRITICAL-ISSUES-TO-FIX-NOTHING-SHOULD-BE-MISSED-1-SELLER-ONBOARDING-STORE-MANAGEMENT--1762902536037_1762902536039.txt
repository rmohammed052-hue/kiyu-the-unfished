## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX - NOTHING SHOULD BE MISSED

### 1. SELLER ONBOARDING & STORE MANAGEMENT (ADMIN DASHBOARD)

**Add Seller Form - Critical Missing Features:**
- The "Add Seller" form lacks Store Type/Category selection dropdown - this must be added as a REQUIRED field
- No product categories are being initialized or assigned based on store type - implement dynamic category assignment tailored to selected store type
- Store banner currently only accepts URL input - replace with proper image upload functionality with preview
- These missing features are blocking sellers from adding products since there are no categories available to select from

**Required Implementation:**
- Add dynamic Store Type/Category dropdown in "Create New Seller" form
- Automatically populate relevant product categories based on selected store type
- Implement image upload component for store banner (not just URL input)
- Ensure all products in that store are strictly tailored to the selected store category

### 2. ADD PRODUCT FORM - STRUCTURE & DYNAMIC FIELDS

**Current Problems:**
- Add Product form lacks structured layout for product display
- Missing product category selection dropdown
- No dynamic fields based on product type (e.g., Size, Color for clothing)
- Form doesn't match the expected structured layout as shown in reference image

**Required Implementation:**
- Restructure the Add Product form with clean, organized layout for better product display
- Add Product Category dropdown that shows ONLY categories relevant to the specific store type
- Implement dynamic, conditional fields based on product type:
  - Clothing: Size, Color (both REQUIRED)
  - Electronics: Specifications, Warranty
  - Food: Expiry Date, Ingredients
  - Any product-specific attributes that must be REQUIRED to complete a purchase
- Display only relevant product categories - do not show categories unless a store of that type exists
- In single store mode, display ONLY the selected store's product categories

### 3. SELLER DASHBOARD - CRITICAL BUGS

**Product Page:**
- Product page in seller dashboard crashes - investigate and fix immediately
- Perform full debugging and error handling

**Orders Page:**
- Orders in seller dashboard show as empty even after orders were placed for the specific store
- Orders should only appear and be counted AFTER payment is completed
- Unpaid/incomplete orders should only be visible to the customer who created them
- After payment, orders should immediately appear in seller dashboard
Ensure view recent order pages redirect to appropriatepage and not mix with personal orders page

**Payment Setup:**
- Payment setup for sellers displays "No store found" error - fix store association logic

**Notifications:**
- Notifications received by sellers after orders are made show as empty - fix notification data population
Cart notification must only show the number of orders not number of cart items added

### 4. DELIVERY & RIDER MANAGEMENT

**Seller Delivery Management:**
- Sellers must be able to manage deliveries and manually assign them to available riders for all orders made
- Display all deliveries with the riders currently handling them
- Allow sellers to select a specific rider to monitor their delivery in real-time…admin can enable and disable permission for this feature ensuring it visibility in the sellers page

**Real-Time Delivery Tracking:**
- Implement real-time geolocation tracking using rider's phone GPS
- Display comprehensive rider information: Vehicle type, Model/Brand, Plate number, Color (based on vehicle type)
- Ensure tracking updates in real-time on seller dashboard

**Automatic Rider Assignment:**
- System should wait approximately 1 hour if no rider is manually assigned by sellers or admin
- After 1 hour, automatically assign an available rider to the order
- Send notification to both sellers AND admin stating: "Rider was automatically assigned after 1hr without manual assignment"…
- Notification must reference the specific order, not number of cart items

**Delivery vs Shipping Terminology:**
- The app currently handles DELIVERY, not shipping
- Remove all "shipping" references and replace with "delivery" throughout the entire platform
- Update delivery methods across all user types consistently

### 5. ADMIN CHAT SYSTEM - DYNAMIC ADMIN ASSIGNMENT

**Current Problem:**
- Default admin account is hardcoded when seller opens chat
- This must be dynamically imported from available admins, not hardcoded

**Required Implementation:**
- Default admin for any chat should be the Super Admin (real account, not hardcoded)
- ANY available admin should receive the message and can reply
- Sellers see different admin profiles depending on who is responding, but under the SAME unified admin chat (no multiple separate chats)
- Super Admin can set any chat from any user type (seller, rider, admin, buyer) as PRIVATE - meaning only admins can see and reply to those messages
- Implement proper admin routing and notification system for incoming chats

### 6. ADMIN PERMISSIONS & RESTRICTIONS

**Current Problem:**
- Admin has restrictions on deleting, creating categories, and performing critical tasks

**Required Implementation:**
- Review ALL available admin permissions and ENTIRELY lift restrictions from the platform unless explicitly required for security
- Ensure all user types have access to 100% of features based on their role type and assigned permissions
- Admin should be able to:
  - Delete categories, products, users as needed
  - Edit products (but NOT change product prices set by sellers - keep this restriction)
  - Perform all CRUD operations appropriate to admin role
- Maintain role-based access control but remove unnecessary restrictions

### 7. ORDERS & DASHBOARD ISSUES

**Recent Orders Section:**
- Recent orders in dashboard cannot be opened - buttons appear dead/non-functional
- Fix all button click handlers and ensure proper navigation

**Order Differentiation - CRITICAL:**
- Currently mixing customer orders with personal orders (from admin, seller, agent, super admin, rider)
- **STRICTLY DIFFERENTIATE** personal orders from client/customer orders
- Create separate views/pages if necessary:
  - Customer/Client Orders (public purchases)
  - Internal Orders (admin, seller, agent, super admin, rider personal purchases)
- "See All" button must redirect to the appropriate page based on order type and user type
- Ensure proper page routing - no mixed redirects

**Order Visibility & Information:**
- Only admins can see customer/user information, payment method, etc.
- Sellers can ONLY see order details (as already implemented)
- Maintain this permission structure across all order views

**Order Counting Logic:**
- Orders should ONLY be counted if payment is completed
- Unpaid/incomplete orders visible only to the customer who created them
- After payment completion, order should be counted and visible to relevant parties (seller, admin)

### 8. ADD NEW RIDER FORM - DYNAMIC FIELDS

**Current Problem:**
- Riders see relevant informations based on vehicle type selected
Approved riders must appear in the assign riders page so admin or seller can assign them
Seller must also have a page to assign riders manually, the riders shown on that page must be those that the admin permitted, add assign rider page in sellers dashboard must be permission based , which can be enable or disable for the sellers to have that features

Rider edit buton in the admit page must import the rider information 

**Required Implementation:**
- In "Add New Rider" form (admin page) and rider application form:
  - Show ONLY relevant fields based on vehicle type selected
  - Example: If Bicycle is selected, do NOT show plate number field
  - Show: Color (REQUIRED for all vehicle types), Vehicle Type, Model/Brand (if applicable)
- Color must be a default REQUIRED field for all vehicle types
- Implement conditional rendering based on vehicle type selection

### 9. CURRENCY DISPLAY & CONVERSION

**Current Problem:**
- Currency convention removes zeros from figures (e.g.,1,23 instead of 1,023.00 for foreign currency)

**Required Implementation:**
- Fix currency formatting to always display two decimal places
- Add toggle button in admin dashboard to control whether based on country selected  language translation should also go along side currency conversion, is enabled/disabled
- Ensure consistent currency formatting across the entire platform

### 10. EXTERNAL ORDERS & PAGE REDIRECTS

**Current Problem:**
- External orders appearing in system
- Improper page redirects throughout application

**Required Implementation:**
- Ensure NO external orders appear in the system
- Audit all page redirects and button actions
- Verify every button redirects to the correct, appropriate page
- No mixed page redirects between order types or user types

Also Message ticking must be on the message just as whatsapp does it, not under or next line after the image 
A video call must have that full screen display with min recipient screen which an be switch  like whatsapp not double parallel screen

In Group call selection , a button to select all or deselect and select a particular user and unselect them

Ensure notification received for all orders must be clearcly communicated, eg. If sellrer , rider, admin etc makes an order it should say “Your payment for order #ORD-1762842581900 was successful. Total: GHS…”  but order from customers must properly indicated it customer order

### 11. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING REQUIREMENTS

**Perform Deep Manual Testing:**
- Test EVERY page in Admin Dashboard
- Test EVERY page in Seller Dashboard  
- Test EVERY page in Rider Dashboard
- Test EVERY page in Agent Dashboard (if applicable)
- Test EVERY page in Buyer/Customer Dashboard

**Verification Checklist:**
- ✅ No dead links to pages
- ✅ All buttons function and redirect to appropriate pages
- ✅ No mixed page redirects
- ✅ Personal orders strictly differentiated from client orders
- ✅ Create appropriate new pages if necessary for proper separation
- ✅ All forms submit correctly
- ✅ All data displays correctly in all dashboards
- ✅ All notifications work properly
- ✅ All real-time features function correctly
- ✅ All role-based permissions enforced correctly

### 12. PRODUCTION READINESS

**Final Requirements:**
- Ensure EVERYTHING works perfectly and is ready for production deployment
- No console errors
- Proper error handling throughout
- Loading states for async operations
- Responsive design across all devices
- Security best practices implemented
- Database queries optimized
- API endpoints secured and efficient
