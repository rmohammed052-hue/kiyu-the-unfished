Decided on mobile redesign summary
✅ Mobile-First Redesign Complete!
I've successfully transformed KiyuMart into a mobile-first application with a beautiful dark theme and orange accent color. Here's what's been implemented:

🎨 Theme Updates
Dark Mode: Deep black backgrounds (#0f0f0f) for true OLED-friendly dark mode
Orange Primary: Vibrant #ff6b35 accent color throughout the app
Mobile-Optimized: Rounded corners, proper spacing, and touch-friendly elements
📱 New Mobile Components
BottomNavigation - Fixed bottom bar with Home, Cart (with badge), Orders, and Profile
MobileHeader - Sticky header with search, notifications, and wishlist icons
CategoryChips - Horizontal scrollable category pills
ProductGridMobile - 2-column product grid optimized for mobile
📄 New Mobile Pages
HomeMobile - Hero banner, category filters, and "Most Popular" section
TrackOrder - Order tracking with 5-stage timeline stepper showing delivery progress
EReceipt - Digital receipts with QR codes, product lists, and export options
MobileNotifications - Card-based notification feed with "New" and "All" tabs
MobileProductDetail - Full-screen product images, color/size variants, quantity picker
🔄 Smart Responsive Routing
The app automatically detects your screen size:

Mobile (< 768px): Shows new mobile-optimized pages
Desktop (≥ 768px): Shows original desktop layout
No Flash: Mobile users see the correct UI immediately (no desktop pre-render)
Same URLs: SEO-friendly - /product/123 works on both mobile and desktop
🚀 Production-Ready Features
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ Proper query guards (no invalid API requests)
✅ Loading and error states
✅ PWA-optimized with theme colors
✅ Efficient resize detection
✅ Clean component architecture

📲 How to Test
On Desktop: Resize your browser window to less than 768px wide to see the mobile view
On Mobile Device: Open the app on your phone - you'll automatically see the mobile interface
Key Features: Try the bottom navigation, view products, track orders, and check notifications
